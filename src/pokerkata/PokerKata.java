Notes to self: 
Subclass more
Make Classes Smaller
Don't use switch statement next time
Try to use less if else
Setup methods to unit test easier
Pass less parameters next time

A quote I made while in coding bootcamp:
To gain knowledge you need to struggle thorough the material
Knowledge canâ€™t go beyond your experience (i.e. the struggle)
Study, watch, learn, collaborate, and code (i.e. the experience)
Believe what you do makes a difference. It does.

Thanks for your time and consideration.
